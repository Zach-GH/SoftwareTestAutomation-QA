# SoftwareTestAutomation-QA
All my work from Software Test Automation &amp; QA

1. Contact Service is from module 3-2 where I run test cases on a stream of objects for an application.

2. Task Service is from Module 4-1 where I run Juniper Unit Tests with JUnit5 on an ArrayList Data Structure that accepts objects with pre-defined parameters. Functionality for the application uses a unique ID to add and delete the objects, in addition to updating the object except for the variable ID.
