How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensuring that code is functional and secure, we can implement different types of testing in order to test the validity of the statements we outline within the software we develop. In addition to this, we need to assure that we are using the proper procedures outlined to test this code, as if we test poorly, we will get poor answers, in addition to missing and even omitting different potential errors and problems that may be severe concerns in the long run for a softwares lifecycle. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting a user's needs can be difficult, especially when incorporating them into a program. This is because the variable of change when it comes to truly understanding a customers problem, can be something even the customer does not know how to effectively communicate. The only real way to assure that there is a proper outline of the requirements is through multiple meeting, and the true, core understanding of the efforts put out by the customer to do the task at hand. There are many other ways to do this such as through the implementation of DevOps, as Developers oversee the operations and even help the customer when they have problems, or even simple questions, and really build a relationship with individuals who are looking to reach an overall goal through the implementation of the tools they are purchasing to do so.

How do I approach designing software?
